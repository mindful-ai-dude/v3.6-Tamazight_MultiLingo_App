![App Demo](assets/images/image-1-tamazight-eyes-intro1280x720px-no-bg.gif)

## Bridging languages, preserving culture, empowering emergency communication.

*"In crisis, every word matters. In preservation, every language counts."*

### üåç Mission: Bridging Communication Gaps in Crisis

This app addresses a critical humanitarian need identified during the devastating 2023 Morocco earthquake, where rescue workers and officials struggled to communicate effectively with Moroccan Berber communities. Our solution provides instant, offline AI-powered translation to ensure no one is left behind during emergencies.

A beautiful, production-ready mobile translation app built with Expo and React Native, featuring offline on device, and online AI translation capabilities for Tamazight (‚µú‚¥∞‚µé‚¥∞‚µ£‚µâ‚µñ‚µú), pronounced "Tamazirt", the indigenous Berber language of Morocco. The app provides seamless multidirectional translation between Tamazight, Arabic, French, and English with specialized features for emergency situations, government/parliamentary use and as a general purpose multi-lingual translation tool.
